## Inkscape Placeholder
Embed image placeholders with custom height and width into Inkscape (currently only from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com))

## How it works
1. Find the extension under the _extensions_ menu in the top bar

## Motivation

For designers, it is very useful to add image placeholders to their designs to see how the design could look and how image fits in space.  
It is also useful to help clients see a temporary image that could help them understand better how a design will look in the future.

## Installation

Copy the files `unsplash.py` and `unsplash.inx` in your extensions local directory

In linux

```
~/.config/inkscape/extensions
```
