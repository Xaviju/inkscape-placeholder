## Motivation

For designers, it is very useful to add image placeholders to their designs to see how the design could look and how image fits in space.  
It is also useful to help clients see a temporary image that could help them understand better how a design will look in the future.

Avatar placehoders: Copy the files `uifaces.py` and `uifaces.inx` into your extensions local directory
